[
.B -n

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Opl2
is an emulator of a single Yamaha 3812 chip, also known as
.SM OPL2.
.PP
The emulated chip is programmed by a stream of commands either from
.I file
or from standard in.
Guided by these commands, it then synthesizes a number of 16 bit little-endian samples for a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz.
Each is duplicated for stereo sound and written to standard out.
.PP
Commands are 4 bytes formatted as follows, where the size of each field is given in bytes between brackets:
.PP
.RS
.IR register [1]
.IR value [1]
.IR delay [2]
.RE
.PP
Each command specifies a
.I value
to be written to an
.SM OPL2
chip
.IR register ,
modifying its internal state.
.PP
The
.I delay
field is stored as a 16-bit unsigned integer in little-endian byte order,
and provides timing.
It is a multiple of a command period, during which the
.SM OPL2
chip may be sampled before processing the next command.
The period itself is the inverse of the command rate, 700 Hz by default.
This rate can be set using the
.B -n
parameter.
